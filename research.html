                Evidence from Microdata</a><br>
              (with Manuel Adelino and Miguel Ferreira) <br>
              Drawing on the lessons of the 2008-2009 foreclosure crisis, governments
              worldwide implemented large-scale debt moratoria in response to the
              COVID-19 pandemic. We study household debt forbearance using account-level
              transactions from a large Portuguese bank and a unique setting combining
              government and private forbearance. We show that the suspension of mortgage
              repayments can have significant and persistent effects on households’
              consumption and savings at 25 and 40 cents per euro of postponed payments.
              The effect is heterogeneous across households with different income and
              wealth: low-income and low-wealth households spend 74 cents per euro,
              consuming above their pre-pandemic average, while high-income and high-wealth
              households save 79 cents per euro with no effect on consumption. In addition,
              we find similar similar effects for the small group of households that
              accepted the extension of the forbearance offered by banks at the end of
              the government forbearance. Our findings suggest that more targeted debt
              relief programs can avoid household financial distress with a lower cost
              to financial institutions.

                Do Specialized Distress Investors Undermine Upstream Lending?</a><br>
              (with Fernando Anjos and Irem Demirci) <br>
              A growing class of investors specializes in funding distressed firms. Specialization
              allows these investors to develop valuable expertise, which in principle can contribute
              to overall economic efficiency. Notwithstanding this argument, we show that specialized
              distress investors (SDIs) can inadvertently worsen borrower moral hazard, since these
              downstream financiers rescue firms after poor performance (bailout effect). Moreover,
              SDI presence can make upstream lenders develop a counter-intuitive preference towards
              projects with lower continuation value and/or worse agency problems, in order to reduce
              SDI entry. In contrast to these results, we show that from a longer-run perspective SDIs
              can actually help in managing borrower moral hazard. This occurs in the model when SDI
              entry makes it easier for upstream lenders to sustain a reputation of toughness, which
              can in turn be critical for disciplining borrowers.

              <a class="highlight-text">How costly is default around the world?
                Evidence from structural estimation</a><br>
              I estimate how the expected cost of default varies across 14 OECD countries.
              To infer the magnitude of cross-country differences, I consider a dynamic
              capital structure model, where firms face corporate taxes, costly external financing
              and costly default and then apply simulated method of moments to the model.
