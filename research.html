                and Savings during COVID-19</a><br>
              (with Manuel Adelino and Miguel Ferreira) <br>
              This paper examines the response of households' savings and consumption to a
              large-scale mortgage forbearance programs. We use data from a large Portuguese
              bank that combine individual credit and debit card transactions, transfers into
              the bank, and account-level balances to measure monthly income, consumption
              expenditure, and savings. We show that postponing mortgage payments during the
              Covid-19 pandemic had a large impact on both consumption and savings, but with
              heterogeneous impacts across income and wealth groups. Low-income and low-wealth
              individuals in forbearance increase spending by 74 cents per euro of postponed
              loan payments, corresponding to an average consumption above the pre-pandemic
              level. In contrast, households in the high-income, high-wealth group increase
              savings by 79 cents per euro of postponed payments. Our findings suggest that
              the combination of forbearance programs and income supplements may not be
              necessary to avoid widespread loan defaults during a crisis.

                Investors Undermine Upstream Lending?</a><br>
              (with Fernando Anjos and Irem Demirci) <br>
              We extend the canonical model of corporate finance under moral hazard to allow for specialized
              distress investors (SDIs) and ask whether and how these financiers create negative externalities
              for upstream lending. In our model SDIs potentially participate in the firm at an interim stage,
              only following poor performance. Under certain conditions the presence of SDIs can per se make
              (theoretically) positive-NPV projects impossible to fund ex ante, by inadvertently making it
              more expensive to incentivize the borrower and/or by reducing the initial lender's ex post surplus
              conditional on poor performance. Furthermore, SDIs can reduce a project's ex ante NPV, even when
              they do not affect borrower incentives nor expropriate lenders ex post. Finally, we also show how
              SDI presence can compromise the initial lender's ability to develop and maintain a reputation.

                Evidence from structural estimation</a><br>
              I estimate how the expected cost of default varies across 14 OECD countries.
              To infer the magnitude of cross-country differences, I consider a dynamic
              capital structure model, where firms face corporate taxes, costly external financing
              and costly default and then apply simulated method of moments to the model.
