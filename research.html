                The Heterogeneous Effects of Household Debt Relief</a><br>
              (with Manuel Adelino and Miguel Ferreira) <br>
              Large-scale debt forbearance is a key policy tool during crises, yet targeting is challenging due
              to information asymmetries. Using transaction-level data from a Portuguese bank during COVID-19,
              we find financially fragile households are more likely to enter forbearance, irrespective of income
              shock. Mortgage payment suspension increases consumption and savings, but effects differ across
              households. Low-wealth and low-income households exhibit higher consumption sensitivity to
              forbearance, while high-wealth and high-income households show greater saving sensitivity.
              Additionally, ineligible households accessing forbearance show a higher consumption sensitivity
              than eligible ones. Our findings suggest considering observable household characteristics could
              enhance the effectiveness of debt relief policies.

                Do Specialized Distress Investors Undermine Firms Ex Ante?</a><br>
              (with Fernando Anjos and Irem Demirci) <br>
              We extend the canonical moral hazard model in corporate finance to include
              specialized distress investors (SDIs), who privately bail out financially-distressed firms.
              First, we show that SDIs can negatively impact credit rationing ex ante,
              even when SDIs create value and even though initial lenders are required to agree to SDI
              participation. Second, we show that SDI presence can lower project NPV, when initial
              lenders can exploit a value-destroying SDI’s technology to expropriate equityholders ex post.
              These negative results notwithstanding, we also show that firms can sometimes mitigate these
              effects by strategically choosing projects with certain characteristics, namely lower duration.

                Homemade Unleverage: Do Households Care About Employers' Leverage?</a><br>
              Exploiting a rich dataset of matched households and employers, I provide novel
              evidence on the impact of the employer's capital structure on employees' consumption
              and saving decisions. Despite receiving lower wages, households working for
              highly leveraged employers exhibit lower marginal propensities to consume. This effect
              is driven by cutting in "luxury" goods and services, thus suggesting a novel channel
              through which financial distress costs spill over to other&ndash;potentially unrelated&ndash;firms:
              the employee-spending channel. To establish causality, I look at employees' responses to
              negative industry-wide shocks and find that only those employed by high-leverage firms cut
              consumption, though I find no differential effect on wages. I reconcile these facts with a
              Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides matching model, in which heterogeneous risk-averse employees
              bargain with heterogeneous employers to determine wages. Consistent with the model,
              the consumption response is mainly driven by poorer households, for whom unemployment is
              more painful. Overall, evidence is suggestive that financial distress costs are being
              partially shifted to employees.
