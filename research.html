                The Heterogeneous Effects of Household Debt Relief</a><br>
              (with Manuel Adelino and Miguel Ferreira) <br>
              Large-scale debt forbearance is a key policy tool in times of economic distress,
              but it is challenging to design a targeted program due to information asymmetries
              between lenders and borrowers. Using transaction-level data from a leading Portuguese bank,
              we study which households access a widely advertised and easily accessible forbearance program
              during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it affects household consumption and savings. We show that
              the average household that enters forbearance is fragile, and suspending mortgage payments
              has positive and persistent effects on consumption and savings. The effects, however, are
              very heterogeneous across households. Households eligible for forbearance avoid a drop in
              consumption, while ineligible households, who nevertheless access forbearance, increase
              consumption. In addition, the consumption response is stronger among low-wealth and low-income
              households, while the savings response is stronger among high-wealth and high-income households.

                Do Specialized Distress Investors Undermine Upstream Lending?</a><br>
              (with Fernando Anjos and Irem Demirci) <br>
              A growing class of investors specializes in funding distressed firms. Specialization
              allows these investors to develop valuable expertise, which in principle can contribute
              to overall economic efficiency. Notwithstanding this argument, we show that specialized
              distress investors (SDIs) can inadvertently worsen borrower moral hazard, since these
              downstream financiers rescue firms after poor performance (bailout effect). Moreover,
              SDI presence can make upstream lenders develop a counter-intuitive preference towards
              projects with lower continuation value and/or worse agency problems, in order to reduce
              SDI entry. In contrast to these results, we show that from a longer-run perspective SDIs
              can actually help in managing borrower moral hazard. This occurs in the model when SDI
              entry makes it easier for upstream lenders to sustain a reputation of toughness, which
              can in turn be critical for disciplining borrowers.

                Homemade Unleverage or: Do Households Care About the Employer's Capital Structure?</a><br>
              Exploiting a rich dataset of matched households and employers, I provide novel evidence on the
              impact of the employer's capital structure on employees' consumption and saving decisions.
              Notwithstanding receiving lower wages, households working for highly leveraged employers
              exhibit lower marginal propensities to consume, with this effect being driven by cutting in
              ``luxury'' goods and services. To establish causality, I look at employees' responses to
              negative industry-wide shocks and find that only those employed by high-leverage firms cut
              consumption, though I find no differential effect on wages. I reconcile these facts with a
              Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides matching model, in which heterogeneous risk-averse employees
              bargain with heterogeneous employers to determine wages. Consistent with the model, I find
              that the consumption response is mainly driven by poorer households, for whom unemployment
              is more painful. Overall, evidence is suggestive that financial distress costs are being
              partially shifted to employees.
