                and Savings during COVID-19</a><br>
              (with Manuel Adelino and Miguel Ferreira) <br>
              This paper examines the response of households' savings and consumption to a
              large-scale mortgage forbearance programs. We use data from a large Portuguese
              bank that combine individual credit and debit card transactions, transfers into
              the bank, and account-level balances to measure monthly income, consumption
              expenditure, and savings. We show that postponing mortgage payments during the
              Covid-19 pandemic had a large impact on both consumption and savings, but with
              heterogeneous impacts across income and wealth groups. Low-income and low-wealth
              individuals in forbearance increase spending by 74 cents per euro of postponed
              loan payments, corresponding to an average consumption above the pre-pandemic
              level. In contrast, households in the high-income, high-wealth group increase
              savings by 79 cents per euro of postponed payments. Our findings suggest that
              the combination of forbearance programs and income supplements may not be
              necessary to avoid widespread loan defaults during a crisis.

                Do Specialized Distress Investors Undermine Upstream Lending?</a><br>
              (with Fernando Anjos and Irem Demirci) <br>
              A growing class of investors specializes in funding distressed firms. Specialization
              allows these investors to develop valuable expertise, which in principle can contribute
              to overall economic efficiency. Notwithstanding this argument, we show that specialized
              distress investors (SDIs) can inadvertently worsen borrower moral hazard, since these
              downstream financiers rescue firms after poor performance (bailout effect). Moreover,
              SDI presence can make upstream lenders develop a counter-intuitive preference towards
              projects with lower continuation value and/or worse agency problems, in order to reduce
              SDI entry. In contrast to these results, we show that from a longer-run perspective SDIs
              can actually help in managing borrower moral hazard. This occurs in the model when SDI
              entry makes it easier for upstream lenders to sustain a reputation of toughness, which
              can in turn be critical for disciplining borrowers.

                Evidence from structural estimation</a><br>
              I estimate how the expected cost of default varies across 14 OECD countries.
              To infer the magnitude of cross-country differences, I consider a dynamic
              capital structure model, where firms face corporate taxes, costly external financing
              and costly default and then apply simulated method of moments to the model.
